# MiniReset.css

A tiny modern CSS reset that covers the basics:

* **resets the font sizes**: so that using semantic markup doesn't affect the styling
* **resets the block margins**: so that the spacing is only applied when you need it
* **preserves the inline margins**: so that buttons and inputs keep their default layout
* **sets the border-box box sizing**: so that borders and paddings don't affect the set dimensions
* **sets responsive media elements**: so that images and embeds scale with the browser width
* **resets tables**: so that tabular data only takes the space it needs

## Install
